> Build products from first principles: starting with why, expose the constraints, instrument the loop, and use AI to search the solution space faster. The goal it’s move faster -- better questions, tighter feedback, more reliable outcomes.


### How I work
- Clarity first. Translate fuzzy goals into testable hypotheses and guardrails; pick the smallest slice that proves value.
- Observable workflows. Traceable inputs → steps → outputs; stochastic exploration to widen options, deterministic checks where decisions matter.
- Human-in-the-loop by design. Keep people as goal-setters and editors; use AI for proposals, drafts, counter-examples, and stress tests.
- Instrumentation over intuition. Ship with evaluators, logs, and quality checks; iterate on real signals, not vibes.
- Integrity is a feature. Reliability, safety, explainability, and security are product requirements—not add-ons.

### What I do
- Lead product end-to-end: problem framing, exploratory prototypes, measurable launches, and continuous evaluation.
- Design human–AI workflows that amplify judgment (co-drafting, counter-pattern search, auto-evaluators/guardrails).
- Build systems that connect text, data, and code so teams spend less time searching and more time synthesizing.

### Background (snapshot)
Product leadership across AI, data, and software security; founder experience; earlier stints in analytics and growth. Recent roles span large-scale orgs and startups, with impact anchored in instrumentation, reliability, and user-centric design.

> I treat intelligence as guided search: humans keep the *why* and the standards; machines expand the search and tighten the loop.
