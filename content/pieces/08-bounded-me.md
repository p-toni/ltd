I keep getting tempted by clean definitions.

Information as entropy.
Intelligence as compression.
Learning as “matching a distribution.”

Those definitions are elegant, but they don’t cash out in my actual life.

In my life, “information” is not what exists in the world. It’s what I can [*pull into myself* under constraints](tooltip:A1): time, attention, energy, compute, mood, calendar, context.

I don’t experience the universe. I experience the slice I can process.

So the question isn’t “how much information is there?”
It’s “what structure is [extractable for *me*, right now, with my limits?](tooltip:A2)”

That’s the only definition that stays stable across days where I’m sharp, days where I’m foggy, and days where I’m pretending.

---

## 1) [Bounded me](tooltip:A2)

When I say “I learned something,” what I mean is:

* I found a pattern that survived contact with my schedule.
* It became cheap to recall.
* It started generating predictions or choices with low friction.

So “information” isn’t a property of the thing I read. It’s a property of the [*interaction* between that thing and my constraints](tooltip:A1).

Some days, the same paragraph is dead text.
Other days, it turns into a lever.

That makes me suspect that a lot of my confusion comes from treating my mind like an unbounded observer. I keep asking what’s “true” in the abstract, when what matters is what I can distill into internal programs.

A good piece of writing for me isn’t one that contains the most novelty.
It’s one that [increases the amount of structure I can reliably extract later](tooltip:A2).

That’s the bar: **does it [reduce future compute for me?](tooltip:A3)**

One more private corollary: sometimes [computation itself creates something I can learn](tooltip:A4). Not “new truth,” but new *extractable structure* for bounded-me.

---

## 2) “Memory” as geometry (not storage)

I don’t want a second brain that is a library.

A library gives you retrieval.
It doesn’t give you shape.

What I actually need is [a geometry: a coordinate system](tooltip:C1) where ideas have distance, direction, neighbors, borders—so that reasoning becomes movement instead of lookup.

This is the difference between:

* storing facts, and
* [arranging facts so they become *navigable*](tooltip:C2).

When my thinking is good, it’s because I’ve built a local geometry:

* I know where the “hard” parts are,
* I know what’s adjacent,
* I can move from one concept to another without re-deriving everything from scratch.

When my thinking is bad, I’m trapped in flat text. Everything is equally far away.

So when I write, I’m not trying to “publish.”
I’m trying to [carve geometry into my own space](tooltip:C2).

The draft fails when it reads like notes about other people’s ideas.
The draft succeeds when it changes the topology of my own.

## 3) The fractal edge in my own training

There’s a boundary in my life that feels like training stability.

On one side: I’m compounding. It [converges. The loop is tight](tooltip:D1). Small inputs become durable progress.
On the other side: everything diverges. I’m “busy,” but nothing converges.

And that boundary isn’t a clean line.

It’s [sensitive. Weirdly sensitive](tooltip:D2).

If I zoom in, the difference between a good week and a trash week can be:

* one meeting at the wrong time,
* one small breach of sleep,
* one subtle context switch I didn’t respect,
* one “I’ll just do this quickly” that turns into a lost evening.

From far away, it looks like discipline.
Up close, it looks like dynamical systems.

So I want to treat my own productivity like trainability: not moral, not identity—just stability conditions.

Not “why am I like this?”
But “what hyperparameters keep me in the [convergent basin](tooltip:D1)?”

Writing is part of that. A piece is not just output; it’s *a stabilizer* if it makes my next actions less chaotic.

---

## 4) Information as flow through the loop

I like the idea that information isn’t only stored. [It flows](tooltip:B1).

In my life, “flow” is literal:

* it flows into attention,
* it flows into notes,
* it flows into decisions,
* it flows into habits,
* it flows into products,
* it flows back as feedback.

Most of the time, I lose information not because it wasn’t there, but because it [leaked at a transition](tooltip:B2):

* I read something but didn’t integrate it.
* I had an insight but didn’t attach it to a decision.
* I made a decision but didn’t make it executable.
* I executed but didn’t close the loop with feedback.

So the real unit of improvement isn’t “better memory.”
It’s **[lower-leakage loops](tooltip:B2)**.

This is why “writing from inside my head” matters. Because writing is the part of the loop where I convert diffuse impressions into a structured object I can re-enter later.

If the writing is for others, I optimize for legibility.
If the writing is for me, I optimize for *re-entry*.

The point is: future-me can jump back in and regain the geometry quickly.

## 5) A private metric: did the piece increase [extractable structure](tooltip:A2)?

I need a way to evaluate whether this piece is “good,” without referencing audience.

So here’s the metric:

After writing it, do I notice that:

* I make faster decisions in the same domain?
* I can explain the core tension to myself in fewer steps?
* I reuse the concept naturally without prompting?
* I feel a drop in “mental compilation time”?

If yes, the piece increased extractable structure.
If no, it’s just text.

This is also a test for working with AI.

If the AI produces clean paragraphs that don’t change my internal geometry, that’s not “me.”
That’s a ghostwriter.

The role I want is different: co-authoring as instrumentation. The AI helps me scan the space, but the piece must be a faithful compression of *my loop*.

Which means the draft has to contain my constraints, not just my references.

---

## 6) The actual thesis (for me)

Information is not a number.

> Information is structural signal that (1) a [bounded learner can extract](tooltip:SYN1A), (2) often [crystallizes into geometry](tooltip:SYN1C), (3) [survives chaotic training dynamics](tooltip:SYN1D), and (4) [behaves like flow through a loop](tooltip:SYN1B).

It’s [what my loop can extract under constraints](tooltip:A1)—then keep stable—then reuse.

My job is to [build geometry](tooltip:C1), reduce leakage, and stay in the [convergent basin](tooltip:D1).

This is why I keep building systems. Not because I love tools.
Because my mind is bounded, and I want to [increase what’s extractable](tooltip:A2) without [increasing fragility](tooltip:D2).

Writing is one of my best tools for that.
But only when it’s written from inside my head.

Not what sounds right.
What changes what I do next.
