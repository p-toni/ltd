excerpt: Why software should feel like playing music
---
The best software doesn't feel like software—it feels like an instrument. There's a tactile quality, an immediacy of response, a sense that you're manipulating something real rather than navigating abstractions.

Consider the OP-1: it's a synthesizer, a sampler, a sequencer, yet it never feels overwhelming. Each function is discoverable through use, not documentation. The interface rewards exploration. You learn by doing, not by reading.

This is the opposite of most software, which treats users as problems to be solved rather than musicians to be empowered. Menus within menus. Settings buried in settings. Confirmation dialogs that confirm nothing. The friction isn't accidental—it's structural.

What would it mean to design software as instruments? To prioritize feel over features? To trust users to explore rather than constraining them with guardrails? The answer might look less like traditional apps and more like playgrounds for focused creativity.
