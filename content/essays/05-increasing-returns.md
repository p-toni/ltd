excerpt: W. Brian Arthur on Business Ecology

> “You need an awareness of the ecology you are in. If you think of different firms and products as being different species, then you have to be very aware of how that entire network of different companies operates, even if they are quite peripheral to you.”

> — W. Brian Arthur, *Increasing Returns and the New World of Business* (Harvard Business Review, 1996)

**Why it matters**
- Strategy is ecological: products and companies co-evolve inside interdependent networks.
- Peripheral actors can still reshape the environment; blind spots emerge when you ignore weak ties.
- Monitoring the full ecosystem helps anticipate shifts, niche opportunities, and compounding feedback loops.
