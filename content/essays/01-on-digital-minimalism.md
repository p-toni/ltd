excerpt: Exploring the intersection of technology and intentional living
---
In an age of infinite digital abundance, the most radical act might be choosing less. Digital minimalism isn't about rejecting technologyâ€”it's about being deliberate with our attention and energy. Every notification, every app, every screen demands a piece of our consciousness. The question isn't whether we use technology, but whether we control it or it controls us.

The teenage.engineering philosophy offers a blueprint: maximum function, minimum form. Every element serves a purpose. Nothing is decorative. This principle extends beyond product design into how we structure our digital lives. What if we applied the same rigor to our apps, our feeds, our digital habits?

The path forward isn't abstinence but intentionality. Choose tools that amplify your capabilities without fragmenting your attention. Design systems that serve your goals rather than hijacking them. In the end, digital minimalism is about reclaiming agency in a world designed to capture it.
