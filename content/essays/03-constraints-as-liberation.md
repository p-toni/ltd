excerpt: How limitations unlock creativity
---
Infinite possibility is paralyzing. Give someone unlimited options and they freeze. Give them three carefully chosen constraints and they create.

This is the paradox at the heart of creative work: freedom comes from limitation. The haiku's 5-7-5 structure. The OP-1's four-track limit. Twitter's original 140 characters. These aren't bugsâ€”they're features.

Constraints force decisions. They eliminate the anxiety of infinite choice and replace it with the clarity of defined boundaries. Within those boundaries, creativity flourishes because energy isn't wasted on meta-decisions about what's possible.

The challenge is choosing the right constraints. Too tight and you're trapped. Too loose and you're back to paralysis. The sweet spot is where limitation creates just enough friction to spark innovation without crushing it. That's where the magic happens.
